## Who are we? ##
We come from different backgroud that include biology, medecine, mathematics, informatics, software development and a lot of other fields.
We are mainly from Munich; this could change in the future.

## What is bioinformatics? ##
Bioinformatics is at the interface between biology and informatics.
It is an interdisciplinary field that develops and uses tools (methods and software) for understanding and analysing biological data.

## Why join us on the mailing list? ##
It is a convenient way to stay informed of the last news.

## Why join us during our events? ##
Life without interractions would be sad. It is so much nicer to organise some meetup!

## Goal of the community ##
We hope this small community will help with promoting interdisciplinary research atmosphere in Munich!
It is important that the members present their work/interests to help people from other fields/different academic backgrounds get into the state of art.
