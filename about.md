## Who are we? ##
We are just normal people, trust me.
We come from different backgroud that include biology, math, informatics, software development and a lot of other fields.
We are mainly from Munich; this could change in the future.

## What is bioinformatics? ##
Bioinformatics is at the interface between biology and informatics. 
It is an interdisciplinary field that develops and uses tools (methods and software) for understanding and analysing biological data.

## Why join us on the mailing list? ##
E-Mails allows fast communication.
It is a very convenient way to interract from anywhere on the planet, at (almost) no costs, while keeping archive easily.

## Why join us during our events? ##
Life without interractions would be sad.
