Welcome to the small community of bioinformatic life in Munich. You will also find here articles, events, tips...

We organize meetup regularly to share knowledge, new ideas and help to promote a growing community
in Munich.

It is important that the members try to present the things they are doing, helping people from other
fields to get into the state of art and get feedback from people with different academic
backgrounds.

We hope this small community will help with promoting interdisciplinary research atmosphere in
Munich!
